== Build Cache

NOTE: This feature is a work in progress.

NOTE: The build cache feature described here is different from the http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/build-cache[Android plugin build cache].

[[sec:build-cache-intro]]
=== Overview

A _build cache_ is a cache mechanism that aims to save time by reusing outputs produced by other builds.
The build cache works by storing (locally or remotely) build outputs and allowing builds to fetch these outputs from the cache when it is determined that inputs have not changed, avoiding the expensive work of regenerating them.

A first feature using the build cache is _task output caching_.
Essentially, task output caching leverages the same intelligence as <<sec:up_to_date_checks,UP-TO-DATE checks>> that Gradle uses to avoid work when a previous local build has already produced a set of outputs.
But instead of being limited to the previous build in the same workspace, task output caching allows Gradle to reuse build outputs from any earlier build in any location.
When using a shared build cache for task output caching this even works across developer machines and build agents.

Apart from task output caching, we expect other features to use the build cache in the future.

[[sec:build_cache_enable]]
=== Enable the Build Cache

By default, the build cache is not enabled. You can enable the build cache in a couple of ways:

Run with `--build-cache` on the command-line.::
Gradle will use the build cache for this build only.
Put `org.gradle.caching=true` in your `gradle.properties`.::
Gradle will try to reuse outputs from previous builds for all builds, unless explicitly disabled with `--no-build-cache`.

This will automatically configure the `local` build to store data in a directory on a local disk.

Gradle also supports sharing a `remote` cache between many Gradle builds running on different machines. We'll be discussing their use a little further down.

[[sec:build_cache_configure]]
=== Configure the Build Cache

You can configure the build cache by using the pass:[<apilink class='org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings' method="buildCache(org.gradle.api.Action)"/>] block in `settings.gradle`.

Gradle supports a `local` and a `remote` build cache that can be configured separately.
When both build caches are enabled, Gradle tries to load build outputs from the local build cache first and then tries the remote build cache if no build outputs are found.
Gradle pushes build outputs to any build cache that is enabled and has pass:[<apilink class='org.gradle.caching.configuration.BuildCache' method="isPush()" />] set to `true`.

By default, the local build cache has push enabled, and the remote build cache has push disabled.

The local build cache is pre-configured to be a pass:[<apilink class='org.gradle.caching.local.DirectoryBuildCache'/>] and enabled by default.
The remote build cache can be configured by specifying the type of build cache to connect to (pass:[<apilink class='org.gradle.caching.configuration.BuildCacheConfiguration' method="remote(java.lang.Class)"/>]).
Custom remote build cache types can be registered via pass:[<apilink class='org.gradle.caching.configuration.BuildCacheConfiguration' method="registerBuildCacheService(java.lang.Class, java.lang.Class)"/>].

Gradle supports connecting to a remote build cache backend via HTTP. This can be configured in `settings.gradle`.
For more details on what the protocol looks like see pass:[<apilink class='org.gradle.caching.http.HttpBuildCache'/>].
Note that by using the following configuration the local build cache will be used for storing build outputs while the local and the remote build cache will be used for retrieving build outputs.

++++
<sample id="httpBuildCache" dir="buildCache/http-build-cache" title="Pull from HttpBuildCache">
    <sourcefile file="settings.gradle" snippet="http-build-cache"/>
</sample>
++++

The recommended use case for the build cache is that your continuous integration server populates the remote build cache with clean builds while developers pull from the remote build cache and push to a local build cache. The configuration would then look as follows.

++++
<sample id="developerCiSetup" dir="buildCache/developer-ci-setup" title="Recommended setup for CI push use case">
    <sourcefile file="settings.gradle" snippet="developer-ci-setup"/>
</sample>
++++

You can configure the directory the pass:[<apilink class='org.gradle.caching.local.DirectoryBuildCache'/>] uses to store the build outputs and
the credentials the pass:[<apilink class='org.gradle.caching.http.HttpBuildCache'/>] uses to access the build cache server as shown in the following example.

++++
<sample id="directoryAndHttpBuildCacheConfiguration" dir="buildCache/configure-built-in-caches" title="Configure built-in build caches">
    <sourcefile file="settings.gradle" snippet="configure-built-in-build-caches"/>
</sample>
++++

[[sec:task_output_caching]]
=== Task Output Caching

Beyond incremental builds described in <<sec:up_to_date_checks>>, Gradle can save time by reusing outputs from previous executions of a task by matching inputs to the task.
Task outputs can be reused between builds on one computer or even between builds running on different computers via a build cache.

NOTE: This feature is a work in progress and is automatically enabled when you enable the build cache, see <<sec:build_cache_enable>>.

[[sec:task_output_caching_faster]]
=== Making builds faster

Since a task describes all of its inputs and outputs, Gradle can compute a _build cache key_ that uniquely defines the task's outputs based on its inputs.
That build cache key is used to request previous outputs from a build cache or push new outputs to the build cache. If the previous build is already populated by someone else, e.g. your
_continuous integration_ server or other developers, you can avoid executing most tasks locally.

The following inputs contribute to the build cache key for a task in the same way as they do for <<sec:how_does_it_work,up to date checks>>:

* The task type and its classpath
* The names of the output properties
* The names and values of properties annotated as described in <<sec:task_input_output_annotations>>
* The names and values of properties added by the DSL via pass:[<apilink class="org.gradle.api.tasks.TaskInputs"/>]
* The classpath of the Gradle distribution, buildSrc and plugins
* The content of the build script when it affects execution of the task

Task types need to opt-in to task output caching using the `@pass:[<apilink class="org.gradle.api.tasks.CacheableTask"/>]` annotation.
Custom task types are _not_ cacheable by default.
Currently, the following built-in Gradle tasks are cacheable:

* Java toolchain:
pass:[<apilink class="org.gradle.api.tasks.compile.JavaCompile" />],
pass:[<apilink class="org.gradle.api.tasks.javadoc.Javadoc" />]
* Groovy toolchain:
pass:[<apilink class="org.gradle.api.tasks.compile.GroovyCompile" />],
pass:[<apilink class="org.gradle.api.tasks.javadoc.Groovydoc" />]
* Code quality tasks:
pass:[<apilink class="org.gradle.api.plugins.quality.Checkstyle"/>],
pass:[<apilink class="org.gradle.api.plugins.quality.CodeNarc" />],
pass:[<apilink class="org.gradle.api.plugins.quality.FindBugs" />],
pass:[<apilink class="org.gradle.api.plugins.quality.JDepend" />],
pass:[<apilink class="org.gradle.api.plugins.quality.Pmd" />]
* Jacoco:
pass:[<apilink class="org.gradle.testing.jacoco.tasks.JacocoMerge" />],
pass:[<apilink class="org.gradle.testing.jacoco.tasks.JacocoReport" />]
* pass:[<apilink class="org.gradle.plugin.devel.tasks.ValidateTaskProperties" />]

For an initial release, we have focused on on the use case where users have an organization wide remote build cache that is populated regularly by continuous integration builds.
Developers and other continuous integration agents should pull cache entries from the remote build cache.
We expect that developers are not allowed to populate the remote build cache and all continuous integration builds are populating the cache while running the `clean` task.

NOTE: If you use a `buildSrc` directory make sure to apply the same <<sec:build_cache_configure,build cache configuration>> to `buildSrc`
and the main build. This can be achieved by applying the same script to `buildSrc/settings.gradle` and `settings.gradle`.

[[sec:task_output_caching_example]]
=== What does it look like

Let us start with a project using the Java plugin which has a few java source files. We run the build the first time.

----
$> gradle --build-cache compileJava
Build cache is an incubating feature.
Using directory (/home/user/.gradle/caches/build-cache-1) as local build cache, push is enabled.
:compileJava
:processResources
:classes
:jar
:assemble

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
----

We see the directory used by the local build cache in the output. Apart from that the build was the same as without the build cache.
Let's clean and run the build again.

----
$> gradle clean
:clean

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
----

----
$> gradle --build-cache assemble
Build cache is an incubating feature.
Using directory (/home/user/.gradle/caches/build-cache-1) as local build cache, push is enabled.
:compileJava FROM-CACHE
:processResources
:classes
:jar
:assemble

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
----

Now we see that, instead of executing the `:compileJava` task, the outputs of the task have been loaded from the build cache.
The other tasks have not been loaded from the build cache since they are not cacheable. This is due to
`:classes` and `:assemble` being <<sec:lifecycle_tasks>> and `:processResources`
and `jar` being `Copy`-like tasks which are not cacheable since it is mostly faster to execute them.

[[sec:build_cache_known_issues]]
=== Feedback and Known Issues

The build cache feature has known issues that may impact the correctness, usability and performance of your build when using the build cache.
These issues will be corrected as this feature becomes stable.

NOTE: When https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/new?labels=in:build-cache[reporting issues with the build cache], please check if your issue is a known issue or related to a known issue.

==== Correctness Issues

NOTE: These issues may affect the correctness of your build when using the build cache. Please consider these issues carefully.

.Correctness Issues
|===
| Description | Impact | Workaround

| Stale outputs left behind by older versions of a plugin or Gradle.
| Gradle does not automatically clean up outputs from other versions of Gradle. In some cases, changing the version of Gradle or changing the version of a plugin can lead to inconsistent builds.
| Use `clean` builds when publishing to a remote build cache.

| Mixed source projects with Java and another JVM language.
| If a project has both Java and another JVM language, the compilation tasks share an output directory. This causes Gradle to mix the result of one task into another. Depending on the order the tasks run, Gradle may delete all output from one of the tasks and cause broken builds.
| Only use one compilation task. For example, if you use Java and Groovy, put all Java sources in `src/main/groovy`.

| Overlapping outputs.
| If two cacheable tasks share an output directory, Gradle does not reliably cache the results from either task.
| Disable caching for both tasks. You can detect this situation by using https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/master/gradle/overlappingTaskOutputsStatsInit.gradle[an init script].

| Tracking the Java vendor implementation
| Gradle currently tracks the major version of Java that is used for compilation and test execution. If your build uses several Java implementations (IBM, OpenJDK, Oracle, etc) that are the same major version, Gradle will treat them all as equivalent and re-use outputs from any implementation.
| Only enable caching for builds that all use the same Java implementation or manually add the Java vendor as an input to compilation and test execution tasks.

| Tracking the Java version
| Gradle currently tracks the major version of Java (6 vs 7 vs 8) that is used for compilation and test execution. If your build expects to use several minor releases (1.8.0_102 vs 1.8.0_25), Gradle will treat all of these as equivalent and re-use outputs from any minor version. In our experience, bytecode produced by each major version is functionally equivalent.
| Manually add the full Java version as an input to compilation and test execution tasks.

| Changes in Gradle's file encoding that affects the build script
| Gradle can produce different task output based on the file encoding used by the JVM. Gradle will use a default file encoding based on the operating system if `file.encoding` is not explicitly set.
| Use UTF-8 file encoding everywhere by setting `file.encoding` to `UTF8` for the Gradle JVM.

| Javadoc ignores custom command-line options
| Gradle's Javadoc task does not take into account any changes to custom command-line options.
| You can add your custom options as input properties or disable caching of Javadoc.

| Missing inputs or outputs for cacheable tasks.
| It's very important that a cacheable task has a complete picture of its inputs so that the results from one build can be safely re-used somewhere else.
Missing task inputs can cause incorrect cache hits, where different results are treated as identical because the same cache key is used by both executions.
Missing task outputs can cause build failures if Gradle does not completely capture all outputs for a given task.
| Use TestKit/integration tests to check that a task is relocatable, produces the same outputs for identical inputs and captures all output files for the task.
|===


==== Usability Issues

NOTE: These issues may affect the number of cache hits you may get between machines.

.Usability Issues
|===
| Description | Impact | Workaround

| Line endings in build scripts files.
| Gradle calculates the build cache key based on the MD5 hash of the build script contents. If the line endings are different between developers and the CI servers, Gradle will calculate different build cache keys even when all other inputs to a task are the same.
| Check if your VCS will change source file line endings and configure it to have a consistent line ending across all platforms.

| Absolute paths in command-line arguments and system properties.
| Gradle provides ways of specifying the path sensitivity for individual task properties (see @pass:[<apilink class="org.gradle.api.tasks.PathSensitive"/>]); however, it's common to need to pass absolute paths to tools or to tests. These kinds of inputs will cause cache misses because not every developer or CI server uses an identical absolute path to the root of a build.
| None.

| `--offline` is not honored for the remote build cache.
| The built-in HTTP build cache ignores the offline flag.
| To completely disable task output caching, use `--no-build-cache`.

| Using JaCoCo disables caching of the Test task.
| The JaCoCo agent relies on appending to a shared output file that may be left over from a different test execution. If Gradle allowed Test tasks to be cacheable with the JaCoCo plugin, it could not guarantee the same results each time.
| None.

| Many errors when reading or writing to the build cache are considered fatal.
| When Gradle fails to store something into the build cache or fails to retrieve something from the build cache, the build may fail. This is usually only a problem with the built-in HTTP remote build cache.
| None.

| Limiting the size of the directory build cache.
| Currently, the directory build cache uses a Gradle-version specific directory that can grow unbounded.
| When using pass:[<apilink class="org.gradle.caching.local.DirectoryBuildCache"/>], periodically delete the directory build cache if it grows too large.

| Adding new actions to cacheable tasks in a build file makes that task sensitive to unrelated changes to the build file.
| Actions added by a plugin (from `buildSrc` or externally) do not have this problem because their classloader is restricted to the classpath of the plugin.
| Avoid adding actions to cacheable tasks in a build file.

| Modifying inputs or outputs during task execution.
| It's possible to modify a task's inputs or outputs during execution in ways that change the output of a task. This breaks incremental builds and can cause problems with the build cache.
| Use a configure task to finalize configuration for a given task. A configure task configures another task as part of its execution.

| Files with volatile data.
| If input files for a cacheable task change on every build, such as when they contain a timestamp, the task is unlikely to have very many build cache hits.
If these files are contained in jars, it can affect the cacheability of Java compilation and test execution.
Java compilation is only affected when the jar is found on the annotation processor classpath.
| You can produce consistently ordered properties files without a timestamp comment with pass:[<apilink class="org.gradle.api.tasks.WriteProperties"/>].

| Order of input files affects outputs.
| Some tools are sensitive to the order of its inputs and will produce slightly different output. Gradle will usually provide the order of files from the filesystem, which will be different across operating systems.
| Provide a stable order for tools affected by order.

| Antlr3 produces output with a timestamp.
| When generating Java source code with Antlr3 and the <<antlr_plugin>>, the generated sources contain a timestamp that reduces how often Java compilation will be cached. Antlr2 and Antlr4 are not affected.
| Use a custom template or remove the timestamp in a `doLast` action.
|===


==== Performance Issues

NOTE: These issues may affect the performance of your build when using the build cache in some scenarios.

.Performance Issues
|===
| Description | Impact | Workaround

| Slow/hanging builds when on a poor connection with the remote build cache enabled.
| For every cacheable task, Gradle will attempt to find a corresponding cache entry in the remote cache. For large cache entries, it may be slower to download the previous result than to recreate it.
| Disable the build cache temporarily with `--no-build-cache`.

| No HTTP timeouts when using the built-in HTTP build cache as a remote build cache.
| Gradle does not enforce any HTTP timeout when downloading a cache entry. On a remote build cache that fails to respond, Gradle will wait indefinitely.
| None.

| Remote cache entries are downloaded each time they are needed.
| Gradle does not keep a local copy of remotely downloaded cache entries. After every clean build, Gradle will need to download all remote cache entries again.
| None.
|===


==== Potential Issues

NOTE: These issues may affect the correctness of the build cache. These issues can only cause problems if your build cache is populated by non-clean builds or caching has been enabled for unsupported tasks.

.Potential Issues
|===
| Description | Impact | Workaround

| Copy-like tasks (`Jar`, `Copy`, `Sync`, `Zip`) do not consider changes to filter or expand in up-to-date checks.
| Changes to the parameters to filter or expand do not cause Copy-like tasks to be executed if that is the only change made to its inputs. See https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/1191[gradle/gradle#1191].
| None. By default, these tasks are not considered cacheable.

| Copy-like tasks (`Jar`, `Copy`, `Sync`, `Zip`) do not consider changes to rename in up-to-date checks.
| Changes to the parameters to rename does not cause Copy-like tasks to be executed if that is the only change made to its inputs. See https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/1150[gradle/gradle#1150].
| None. By default, these tasks are not considered cacheable.

| Copy-like tasks (`Jar`, `Copy`, `Sync`, `Zip`) do not consider system line endings when used with filter or expand.
| When filtering or expanding files while copying them, Copy-like tasks use the system line endings. This can cause files to have different line endings between operating systems. See https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/1151[gradle/gradle#1151].
| None. By default, these tasks are not considered cacheable.
